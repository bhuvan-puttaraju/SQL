 🧠 SQL Practice Repository

Hi! 👋  
This repository is where I practice and improve my SQL skills by solving different problems and real-world case studies.

---

 📌 What’s in this repo?

I’ve included a mix of:

- 📊 Case studies (like Danny’s Diner, Pizza Runner, etc.)
- 🧩 Practice queries to strengthen concepts
- 🎯 Interview-focused SQL questions

The goal is to not just write queries, but to understand how SQL is used in real-world scenarios.
